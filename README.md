üëó Fashion MNIST Project with PyTorch
Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step:

‚úÖ 1. Project Overview
Goal: Classify clothing items (e.g., T-shirt, trousers, pullover, etc.) from grayscale 28x28 pixel images.

Dataset: Fashion MNIST (10 categories, 60k training and 10k test samples)

Task: Multi-class image classification
üß† Fashion MNIST Classification using PyTorch
This project focuses on building an image classification model using PyTorch to recognize various fashion items from grayscale images in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset includes 70,000 labeled images across 10 clothing categories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and sneakers.

üîç Key Highlights:

Preprocessed and loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset using torchvision and DataLoader.

Designed a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers to learn visual patterns in clothing items.

Trained the model using CrossEntropyLoss and Adam Optimizer for multi-class classification.

Evaluated model performance on the test set and achieved accurate classification with minimal overfitting.

Visualized sample predictions to interpret model behavior.

üí° Bonus Improvements (optional additions you can mention if implemented):

Upgraded to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to improve accuracy.

Added Dropout layers and Batch Normalization to reduce overfitting.

Built an interactive UI using Streamlit for real-time predictions on user-uploaded images.

üì¶ Tools & Technologies: Python, PyTorch, torchvision, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
